			<h1>Welcome!</h1>
			<p>This website is a very short tutorial on DirectX. By the end of it you will have an idea
				of what it takes to draw a triangle on the screen.

			<h2>Who should learn DirectX?</h2>
			<p>Honestly... Anyone who wants to learn it. Game programmers, hobbyist... Game programmers, people
				who enjoy tinkering... game programmers. I can't think of anyone else.
			</p>
			<p>
				Graphics is one of my favorite areas of programming. I picked this topic because
				part of me always wanted to do a tutorial teaching what little I know.
